# PythonVideoprocessing
Inspired by Brendan Dawes cinenmaredux work - http://www.brendandawes.com/projects/cinemaredux 
I wrote this script to take the video from my cheap go-pro knock-off helmet camera and create a cinemaRedux style image that shows 1 image for each second of video.
The script is a cut and paste job from various sources so may not win any coding awards but it works.
The code is heavily commented including links to the various stackoverflow posts that I used to help make the script
